# Instructions
hi this is how to apply the thing

im using the [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension to inject css and js

for the css you just copy the entire code in theme.css and paste it in the css section but its very messy lol

same for the script you copy the whole script from script.js and paste it into the javascript section
