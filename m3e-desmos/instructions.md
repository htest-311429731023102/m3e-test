# Instructions
hi this is how to apply the thing

im using the [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension to inject css and js

for the css you can paste this line in the css section in
```css
@import url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/m3e-test/main/m3e-desmos/theme.css');
```
or you can just copy the entire code from theme.css and paste it there if you want to edit the code

for the script, for now you can only copy the whole script from script.js and paste it into the javascript section
