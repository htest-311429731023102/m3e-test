# Instructions
hi this is how to apply the thing

im using the [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension to inject css and js

for the css you can paste this code in your css:
```
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htest-311429731023102/m3e-test/refs/heads/main/m3e-desmos/theme.css)
```
you can also just copy the entire code in theme.css and paste it there but its very messy lol

\
same for the script you can either paste this code into the javascript area or copy the whole script from script.js:
```
$("head").append($("<script></script>").attr("src", url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htest-311429731023102/m3e-test/refs/heads/main/m3e-desmos/script.js")));
```
