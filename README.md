# MDCG Project

hai ! :3

this is my little project thing that gives desmos a slightly more "material expressive 3" style similar to google's design that probably hasnt fully released yet idk man

i started making this sometime in august 2025 and thanks to all the support and feedback from yall in the desmos discord server i was able to continue this project to keep improving it to try to make it better \<3 

especially silostunt who helped make the script.js so that the colors could update automatically using your desmodder primary color which is very cool

ok this was the thing thanks for reading byeeeee \>w\<
